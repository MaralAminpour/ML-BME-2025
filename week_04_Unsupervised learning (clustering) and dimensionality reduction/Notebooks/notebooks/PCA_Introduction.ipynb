        "\n",
        "High-dimensional data is a common issue experienced in machine learning practices, as we typically feed a large amount of features for model training. This results in the limitation of models having **less interpretability and higher complexity** - also known as the curse of dimensionality.\n",

        "\n",
        "PCA can be beneficial when the dataset is **high-dimensional (i.e. contains many features)** and it is widely applied for dimensionality reduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, PCA is also used for discovering the **hidden relationship among feature variables** and **reveal underlying patterns** that could be very insightful. PCA attempts to find linear components that capture as much variance in the data as possible. And **the first principal component (PC1) is typically composed of features that contributes most to the model predictions.**"

        "\n",
        "Think of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) as a way to simplify a lot of data. Here's how it works in simple terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We try to understand how different parts of our data change together using something called a \"covariance matrix.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. We then find some special directions (called \"eigenvectors\") where the data changes the most.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. These special directions help us represent our big, complicated data in a simpler way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, terms like \"covariance matrix\" and \"eigenvector\" might sound fancy. But they're just tools to help us **see our data in a clearer way. So, instead of thinking about them as tricky math things, picture them as cool visual changes to our data. It makes understanding everything a whole lot easier**!"

        "You might remember us chatting about how matrices can be used in math operations, like the dot product. But did you know they can also show us cool visual changes? Let's break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a 2x2 grid or a tiny chessboard. This is our matrix. If you slice it down the middle, you get two lists (we call them vectors). The list on the left is like our horizontal ruler (x-axis), and the one on the right is our vertical ruler (y-axis). Together, they help create a mini world of a 2D space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, there's a special matrix called the \"identity matrix\". It has [1,0] for the horizontal ruler and [0,1] for the vertical one. The cool thing about it? If you mix any list (vector) with this special matrix, you get the same list back!\n",

        "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaralAminpour/course_images/main/imgs_week4_clustering_PCA/matrix1.png.webp' width=500px >\n",
        "\n",
        "Matrix transformation boils down to shifting the scale and direction of the x-axis and y-axis. Imagine the x-axis and y-axis as stretchy rubber bands on a plane. Matrix transformation is like pulling or twisting these bands in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say you tug the x-axis rubber band to make it twice as long. What you're doing is changing its basic direction from [1,0] to [2,0]. This means everything on that axis gets stretched out and becomes double its original size!\n",
        "\n",
        "**In short, playing around with matrices is like giving a new look to our familiar x and y axes.**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "We can additionally combine both the x-axis and y-axis for more **complicated scaling, rotating or shearing transformation**. A typically example is the **mirror matrix** where we swap the x and y axis. For a given vector [1,2], we will get [2,1] after the mirror transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alright, let's jazz things up a bit. We can **play with both the x-axis and y-axis together** for some cool effects like stretching, spinning, or even skewing!\n",
        "\n",
        "Ever played with a mirror? Well, matrices can do something similar. Imagine a matrix that acts like a mirror, **flipping the x and y axes.** So, if you had a point at [1,2], after using our \"mirror\" matrix, it'll land at [2,1]. It's like giving the point a fun house mirror effect!\n",

        "*In Short: covariance matrix represents the pairwise correlations among a group of variables in a matrix form.*\n",
        "\n",
        "Covariance matrix is another critical concept in PCA process that represents the data variance in the dataset. To understand the details of covariance matrix, we firstly need to know that **covariance measures the magnitude of how one random variable varies with another random variable.** For two random variable x and y, their covariance is formulated as below and higher covariance value indicates stronger correlation between two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "let's chat about something called the \"covariance matrix.\" Think of it as a magical table that tells us **how different pieces of our data move together**. It's super important for the PCA process because it captures the heartbeat (or **variance) of our dataset**.\n",
        "\n",

As you can see, the original vectors that are pointing at different directions have become more conformed to the general trend displayed in the original dataset (i.e. the blue dots). Because of this property, covariance matrix is important to PCA in terms of describing the relationship between features.\n",

Representing data using eigenvector and eigenvalue reduces the dimensionality while maintaining the data variance as much as possible.*\n",
        "\n",
        "To make this idea clearer, let's look at an easy-to-follow example. Say we have a matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. One of its special vectors, called an eigenvector, is [1,1], and it has a matching value, known as an eigenvalue, of 1.\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's use our vector [1,1] as an example. When it looks in this \"mirror\", its reflection is... itself! The x and y coordinates don't really change. This is why it's a special vector for our matrix, or what we call an \"eigenvector\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the \"eigenvalue\" of 1 is like a size tag. It tells us that our vector, after transformation, remains the same size and points in the same direction. No stretching or squishing happens.\n",
        "\n",
        "What's super cool is this: instead of using a full-blown matrix to talk about changes, we can use just a single number, the eigenvalue, to summarize the transformation's effect. This eigenvalue is a powerful indicator. It tells us how much of the original data's patterns or \"variance\" is captured by our eigenvector.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, to visualize this, imagine a scatter plot filled with blue dots showing our data spread. Add in our special vector, the eigenvector, as a big red arrow. You'll notice that this red arrow aligns beautifully with the main trend in our data. It's like the backbone, showing where most of the action is happening!\n",
        "\n",
        "In coding terms, we could use a script to draw this picture, highlighting the dominant eigenvector in vibrant red, revealing its alignment with the data's primary direction or variance. It's all about making the abstract concrete and visual!\n",

        "1. **Covariance Matrix Magic**: Remember our fancy table, the covariance matrix? It shows how different parts of our data move together. Especially useful when we have lots of variables!\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Eigenvectors - The Heroes**: These special vectors (eigenvectors) have a knack for capturing the main patterns in data but in a simpler, less cluttered way.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Eigenvalues - The Power Meters**: Each eigenvector has a buddy called an eigenvalue. This buddy tells us how strong or influential its corresponding eigenvector is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, when we mix the covariance matrix with these eigenvectors and eigenvalues, magic happens!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Enter Principal Components (PCs)**:\n",
        "Think of PCs as the all-stars team of eigenvectors. When we calculate the eigenvectors for our covariance matrix, we get these PCs. And just like in sports, there's a ranking!\n",
        "\n",
        "- **PC1**: The top player. The eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue. This is the one that captures the biggest trends in our data. If our data were a story, PC1 would be the headline!\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **PC2, PC3, ... PCn**: The supporting cast. They also capture important patterns but maybe not as prominently as PC1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that red vector in the image? That's our superstar, PC1. It's showing the main direction where our data has the most action.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Does This Matter?**\n",
        "Let's say we want a simpler view of our data without losing too much detail. We'd pick the top PCs (like PC1, PC2) because they hold the most information about the original data, thanks to their high eigenvalues.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, PCA is like a clever camera that captures the essence of our data using fewer, but super informative, shots!"

Because as we pile on more dimensions, our data kinda starts getting lost in all that space. This is what folks call the \"curse of dimensionality\"."

        "\n",
        "So, how does manifold learning come into play? In real-world scenarios, datasets stemming from biological or physical processes often **operate within a restricted range of freedom or dimensionality.** This limitation mirrors the **physical laws governing their formation**. For instance, consider a sequence of photos stitched together to create a **panoramic view**. While each photo might have a resolution of **16 megapixels**, making it seem challenging for a machine to determine overlapping points, the act of capturing these photos is bound by **three dimensions**: the camera's **pitch, roll, and yaw**. Therefore, the data points inherently exist in a dimensionality that's notably less expansive than it appears, albeit slightly more than 3D due to factors like encoding variations and lighting differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** When we talk about \"datasets stemming from biological or physical processes,\" we're referring to information that arises from natural phenomena. These could be anything from the way a plant grows, the path a planet takes around a sun, to the manner in which our heartbeats fluctuate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **\"restricted range of freedom or dimensionality\"** bit is really about simplicity at the heart of complexity. **Even if we gather massive amounts of data about a particular phenomenon, the underlying patterns or rules governing that data might be surprisingly straightforward**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about it like this: imagine you're watching a swarm of birds in the sky, making intricate patterns. If you tried to track the path of **every single bird**, it'd be incredibly complex. But, if you understood a few simple rules about how birds react to their neighbors, you could predict the swarm's patterns. That’s the \"restricted range\" in action. **The countless individual bird movements (high dimensionality) can be understood with a few simple rules (low dimensionality)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason this happens is because of \"physical laws governing their formation.\" In our bird example, those laws might include aerodynamics, the bird’s instinctual behavior, and so on. In other cases, it might be laws of physics, chemistry, or biology. These laws provide a framework or a set of rules that the process has to follow, which often simplifies the underlying patterns we see in the data.\n",

So, you know how manifold learning sounds all fancy and complex? Let's break it down a bit. Imagine you're taking a bunch of photos to make one of those cool panoramic shots. Each photo is super detailed with 16 megapixels. Now, you might think, \"Gosh, how does a computer figure out where these photos overlap? Even though each photo brims with 16 million pixels, **there's an underlying pattern**. The act of taking these photos is akin to a dance with three moves: the tilt (pitch), the side-to-side sway (roll), and the spin (yaw) of the camera. These constraints mean that, despite the apparent complexity of millions of pixels, **the real challenge is understanding this 3D dance**. Consecutive photos will be super similar, making the task much more manageable. The beauty of it all? **By recognizing and exploiting this underlying structure or geometry, we can simplify tasks that might initially seem daunting**.

        "\n",
        "**Steps to Achieve This:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Maximize the Projected Variance:** Think of projection as casting shadows of our data onto a line. We want to pick a line (or direction) such that the shadows are as dispersed as possible. In mathematical terms, this means we're aiming to optimize the formula $u^T S u_1$, where $S$ is the matrix that tells us how our data points vary relative to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Finding the Best Direction:** We can identify the best direction for $u_1$ by employing calculus. By taking the derivative with respect to $u_1$, we can find where our function achieves its maximum value, giving us the most dispersed shadows. So, we want our data to be spread out as much as possible when it's projected onto this direction. In fancy terms, we're maximizing $u^T S u_1$, where $S$ is like a snapshot of how our data moves around.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Restraining our Vector (Setting Some Ground Rules):** Without any limitations, $u_1$ could grow infinitely large. To prevent this, we ensure its magnitude is constrained such that $u^T u_1 = 1$. So, there's a catch. Without rules, $u_1$ could become ridiculously big. So, we have a rule that says $u^T u_1$ has to equal 1, keeping things in check.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **The Role of the Lagrange Multiplier (Introducing a Helper, $\\lambda$):** This is a mathematical method used to solve problems that have constraints. We bring in a new variable, $\\lambda$, to enforce the constraint from the previous step. Our equation then becomes:\n",
        "$$ u^T S u_1 + \\lambda(1 - u^T u_1) $$. So, to make sure we stick to the above rule, we use a little trick called the Lagrange multiplier. Our equation now looks like this:\n",
        "$$ u^T S u_1 + \\lambda(1 - u^T u_1) $$\n",

        "$$ S u_1 = \\lambda u_1 $$\n",

        "7. **Eigenvector's Significance (Why Should We Care?):** The first eigenvector is the direction of maximum variance in our data. Additionally, the corresponding eigenvalue indicates the magnitude of this variance. In other words, the direction of $u_1$, our first eigenvector, is where our data has the most spread or variance. And the number $\\lambda$ tells us just how much spread there is.\n",

        "### The Goal\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **The Infinite Dilemma**: If we just keep increasing the values in $ \\mathbf{u_1} $, our variance will head towards infinity. That's not helpful! So, we need to put a leash on $ \\mathbf{u_1} $ to prevent it from growing uncontrollably.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **The Constraint**: To prevent $ \\mathbf{u_1} $ from heading to infinity, we add a constraint: $$ \\mathbf{u_1^T u_1} = 1 $$. This ensures that the length of the vector is 1, keeping it normalized.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Enter Lagrange**: To enforce our constraint while maximizing the variance, we introduce a helper called the Lagrange multiplier, denoted as $ \\lambda_1 $. Our new expression to maximize becomes $$ \\mathbf{u_1^T S u_1} + \\lambda_1 (1 - \\mathbf{u_1^T u_1} ) $$.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ground Rules:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Orthogonality is Key:** A major assumption in PCA is that the directions we find, like $u_1$ and $u_2$, are perpendicular to each other. This ensures that each direction captures unique patterns.\n",

        "2. **Maximizing the Spread Again:** We want our data to have a good spread when projected onto $u_2$. To quantify this, we look at the expression $u^T S u_2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adding Some Constraints:** We make sure that the length of $u_2$ is normalized, meaning $u^T u_2 = 1$. Also, $u_2$ and $u_1$ shouldn't have any correlation or overlap in capturing patterns. This is ensured by making them uncorrelated:\n",

        "$$ S u_2 - \\lambda u_2 - \\phi u_1 = 0 $$\n",

        "- **PCA**: This is a method used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. It's commonly used to make data easy to explore and visualize. Essentially, PCA transforms the original data into a new coordinate system, where the axes (principal components) are orthogonal (perpendicular) and capture the maximum variance in the data.\n",

If we have a matrix $A$, then the SVD of $A$ is given by $A = U\\Sigma V^T$, where $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices and $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values.\n",

One way to do this is by looking at the data's \"covariance matrix\" and breaking it down. In fancy math terms, this breakdown is called the eigen-decomposition and is written as $S = U\\lambda U^1$.\n",

        "- Now, imagine you're dancing. The \"rotation\" ($U$) is like spinning around on the dance floor. The \"scaling\" ($\\lambda$) is like moving closer or further away from the center of the room. So with PCA, it's like finding the best dance move to capture the rhythm of the music (or in this case, the patterns in the data).\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Implementation**: This is achieved by assessing the eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix. Only the eigenvectors related to non-zero eigenvalues are considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Using SVD for Stability**: In cases where matrices have rank issues, it's more stable to derive the needed eigenvectors and eigenvalues using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: To further reduce data complexity, eigenvalues (and their corresponding eigenvectors) are ranked by magnitude, from the largest to the smallest. The distribution of these values can then be examined to decide how many significant components to retain.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Outcome**: Ultimately, PCA provides a transformed version of the data where the most significant patterns are easily distinguishable. This is achieved by minimizing less important variations or noise in the dataset."
